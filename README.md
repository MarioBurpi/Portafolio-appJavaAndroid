# Portafolio-appJavaAndroid

Be Aware.  This is not his final form.  

My portfolio app is an application for Android devices that shows some mini-projects I have coded in the past.

To start with, the app runs an Splash screen and then shows the information screen about myself (or maybe lorem ipsum).
You can swipe to the left and go to the next screen, thanks to the ViewPager interface that I implemented, then jump
to the OpenWeatherMap screen that brings the data from their public API in real time.
Next screen is the amazing ChatRoom that allows the user send text and photo-taken messages.  OMG, thats amazing!
Finally, you can find on the next screen the Currency Rates info, that also connects to an API and calculates the rates.

In this project I'm using mostly Recyclerview, OkHttp, Firebase Database, Firebase Storage, filling Spinners dynamically,
Intents to the camera, SoundPool, MediaManager, among others.
